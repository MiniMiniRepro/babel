Use this as a template for creating your minimal reproduction of an issue with [Babel](https://github.com/babel/babel). For the API see the `api` branch. For the CLI see the `cli` branch. Unless the problem only occurs with the CLI, prefer to reproduce it with the API.

See [https://github.com/miniminirepro/miniminirepro](https://github.com/miniminirepro/miniminirepro) for general instructions on how to use this repo.
